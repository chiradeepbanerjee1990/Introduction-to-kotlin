/**
 * Data class primary constructor must have only property (val/var) parameters
 *
 * val and var both are used to declare a variable. var is like general variable and
 * its known as a mutable variable in kotlin and can be assigned multiple times.
 * val is like constant variable and its known as immutable in kotlin and can be initialized only single time.

 * Above declaration makes below methods automatically overrides in the class
 * getters (and setters in case of vars) for all properties
   equals()
   hashCode()
   toString()
   copy()
   component1(), component2(), â€¦, for all properties . Component function usage we will see more in data class module
